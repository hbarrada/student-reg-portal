-- Note on prerequisites checking:
-- The domain description states: "To be allowed to register, the student must first fulfill 
-- all prerequisites for the course." We interpret this to apply to direct registration only, 
-- not to being placed on the waiting list. This interpretation is supported by the test cases
-- which expect students to be added to waiting lists regardless of prerequisites.
-- Prerequisites will still be checked when a student is moved from waiting list to registeredÂ status.
-- Function that handles all student registration attempts
